      question: "How far in advance should I book your services?",
      answer: "We recommend booking our services 6-12 months in advance for weddings and 3-6 months for other events. However, we understand that sometimes plans come together quickly, and we'll do our best to accommodate shorter timelines when possible."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in your wedding planning packages?",
      answer: "Our wedding planning packages include initial consultation, vendor coordination, timeline creation, budget management, venue selection assistance, dÃ©cor planning, and day-of coordination. We also offer customizable add-ons like additional planning sessions, rehearsal coordination, and extended day-of support."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle events outside of weddings?",
      answer: "Absolutely! While weddings are our specialty, we plan all types of celebrations including corporate events, birthday parties, anniversaries, baby showers, engagement parties, and holiday gatherings. Each event receives the same level of attention and care."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle budget management?",
      answer: "We work closely with you to establish a realistic budget from the start and provide detailed tracking throughout the planning process. We'll help you prioritize spending on what matters most to you and find creative ways to maximize your budget while achieving your vision."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with vendors I've already chosen?",
      answer: "Of course! We're happy to coordinate with vendors you've already selected. We can also recommend trusted vendors from our network to fill any gaps. Our goal is to create a cohesive team that works together seamlessly for your event."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if there's bad weather for an outdoor event?",
      answer: "We always have contingency plans in place for outdoor events. This includes backup indoor locations, tent rentals, and timeline adjustments. We monitor weather forecasts closely and communicate all backup plans with you well in advance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
      answer: "Yes, we understand that event planning is a significant investment. We offer flexible payment plans that can be customized to your needs, typically with an initial deposit followed by scheduled payments leading up to your event date."
    },
    {
      question: "How many events do you take on per month?",
      answer: "We intentionally limit the number of events we take on each month to ensure every client receives our full attention and expertise. This allows us to maintain our high standards of service and be fully present for your special day."
